Classification training project from kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic

Juptyer Notebook does the following:
Analyzes data for correlations to fill in missing data
Engineers new features
Tests various classification algorithms 
Performs a gridsearch on the top performing models to find the best performing parameters
Applies top algorithm to the test data set for submission
Final section is simple neural networks in tensorflow to compare against traditional ml technique **still underwork
